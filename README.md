# About

scat_db_linux is a program to parse commit patches from the Linux kernel commit history, collecting and storing metadata in a PostgreSQL database. The metadata is primarly targeted towards querying feature scattering over time, but it may also serve other purposes (e.g., studying subsystem size, features per subsystem, etc).

# Migration to GitHub

Our existing BitBucket repository is slowly being migrated to GitHub,
but as long as this process is not fully completed, the BitBucket
copy remains the official one. Our BitBucket repository can be found
[here](https://bitbucket.org/lpassos/scat_db_linux).
